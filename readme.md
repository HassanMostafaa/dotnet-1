### Basic C# Concepts

- Variables: `int x = 5;` declares a variable `x` of type `int` and assigns it the value `5`.
- Data Types: C# has various data types such as `int`, `string`, `bool`, etc.
- Methods: `void MyMethod() { }` declares a method named `MyMethod` that takes no parameters and returns no value.
- Classes: `class MyClass { }` declares a class named `MyClass`.
- Objects: `MyClass myObject = new MyClass();` creates an object of type `MyClass` and assigns it to the variable `myObject`.
- Control Flow: `if (true) { }` executes the code inside the brackets if the condition is true.
